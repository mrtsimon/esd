# Snake Game in Turtle - Readme

## üêç Context

This project was created with the aim of providing a version of the famous Snake game, using the Turtle library in Python. The idea behind this project is to demonstrate how to create a simple game while using a basic graphical interface with Turtle.

### Personal Inspiration

The choice to recreate the Snake game was motivated by childhood nostalgia, where this classic game was an entertaining pastime for me. It was also an opportunity to explore the capabilities of the Turtle library to create simple games with a small graphical interface.

## üéÆ Snake Game

### üêç Presentation

**Snake Game** is a classic video game that originated in the 1970s. It became famous after being integrated into many mobile phones in the 1990s. The concept of the game is simple: guide a snake around the screen to eat food, which makes the snake grow. The goal is to survive as long as possible without colliding with the edges of the screen or with the snake's body.

### Origins

The Snake game was originally created by Taneli Armanto, a Finnish engineer, in 1997. It was included in Nokia phones and became a staple of mobile gaming. Since then, many variations of the game have been developed for various platforms.

### How to Play
- Enter your name to save your progress.
- Use your keyboard keys to control the snake:
  - "W" to go up,
  - "S" to go down,
  - "A" to go left, and
  - "D" to go right.
- Eat the food to make the snake grow and increase your score.
- Avoid hitting the edges of the screen or your own body.
- Try to achieve the highest score possible!

## üíª How to Run the Code

To run the code, make sure you have Python installed on your machine. Copy the code into a Python file (e.g., snake_game.py) and run it with your Python interpreter.

```bash
python3 snake.py
```

### Tutorial Followed for the Project

It was the first time I had to code a Python project with a graphical interface, so I was inspired/followed this [Python tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIwsEJ5y79U).
